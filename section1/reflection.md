## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
Reading and constantly practicing is something I want to strive to reach on a daily basis. I am excited that I can practice coding as much as I have time for. The approach of 10,000 hours is the ultimate goal with quality practice.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
p "Hello World" or I would utilize the IRB and use the greeting = "Hello World"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
#
1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
Integer is a whole number whereas a float uses a decimal with the latter being more accurate in equations.
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p animal
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
In computer programming, string interpolation (or variable interpolation, variable substitution, or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.
#{animal} would print out zebra
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
gets.chomp
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
declaring a variable with "" or using interpolation #{  } with variables and imbedding strings within strings
