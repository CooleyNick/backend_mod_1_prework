## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Understanding that mistakes are essential to learning was the top choice in terms of learning anything in life, especially coding. You have to be very comfortable knowing that these mistakes will come, but they are all a learning experience to make you a better programmer. Another point that coincides with mistake making is focusing on the process. I have encountered this many times in my life and have begun to see the pattern when learning anything new, especially when you're in school for it. The school is designed to guide you through this "process", as long as you put the effort in, you will see success.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate a growth mindset with just about every aspect of my life and have become drawn to this mentality after seeing where you grow from it. Whether it's a house project I have never encountered, a skill that I have yet to develop in computer skills, the hospital setting, I am always eager to learn and grow, or even learn a new way to approach a task. This lifelong learning mentality keeps me engaged and helps me succeed.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a collection of key-value pairs and is not organized as an indexed list, such as how array's are.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {"dog bowls": 800, "leashes": 432, "frisbees: 34"}
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states[:IA] => "Iowa"
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys and states.values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
We could utilize a hash to come up with a shopping list for Lowes, including pricing and quantity. A hash would be more beneficial than a list in an array because I can create significantly more data in regards to my list, such as: pricing for budgets, quantities, colors etc...
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I mainly want to see more real world examples and how companies utilize them to make tasks easier and more readable.
